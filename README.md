# python_p2p_chat
Player to player desktop GUI chat application where one user becomes the host/server and other users can join the room as clients. Made in Python 3.4 and Tkinter.

Just run "python p2p_chat.py" in the same directory as p2p_chat.py using Python 3. You might need X server if using Windows.

Note: You can't use this app to communicate with your friends outside of your network if the host is using a router (behind a NAT) as this app doesn't support NAT hole punching, yet.

Note: Currently, the python process just hangs when you exit the program. Go to your Task Manager (Ctrl + Alt + Del) to force close the Python application.

### Features good to be added:
- Aggregate messages from the same user
- Different colored user names for each user
- Time of messages sent
- List showing joined users
- Complete Korean support (Needs to upgrade Tkinter version)
- Connect to host behind NAT (Needs a broker for NAT hole punching)
- Mutual authentication and encryption of data


### Possible code improvements:
- Use message header to indicate how many bytes are being sent
- When pasting into ip and port entry while the content is selected, the validation logic should pass it if the resulting string is within the limit
